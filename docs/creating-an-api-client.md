# Stages

There are three stages to go through to create or update an API client package:

1. [Create an OpenAPI specification](generating-an-openapi-spec-for-the-localgov-ims-api.md) for your API
2. [Create an API client](creating-an-api-client-from-an-openapi-specification.md) from an OpenAPI specification
3. [Package your API client](packaging-your-api-client.md) as a NuGet package
